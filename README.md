Feature selection via regularization: LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net


This repository contains the code and data to reproduce my report "Feature Selection via Regularization: School Proficiency Case."  In social science, statistical models are often developed exclusively on the findings of previous research and the patterns found during a project's exploratory phase. In this report, I argue that LASSO, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net can enhance this practice. The results suggest that, with these methods, researchers can develop sparser models with equal predictive performance as those models built “manually” and can identify similar factors as being significantly associated with their outcome of interest. 


The project used data from elementary and middle schools in the state of New York. The data was retrieved from public databases, which are specified in the paper. 

The statistical concepts included in this project include:
-	Logistic Regression
-	LASSO
-	Ridge Regression
-	Elastic Net
-	Bootstrap Confidence Intervals
-	Out of sample predictions
-	Exploratory analysis and visualizations
